Attempting to RT and post daily summaries via #100DaysOfRuby. Follow for updates!

I should leave a note that, like most of you, I do this outside of daily responsibilities and so some days will be as simple as "Installed this" or "Updated File structures in projects". The important part is that something is being learned each day and shared for others to learn from.

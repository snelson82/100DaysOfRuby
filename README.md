## Daily Goal

To learn and improve my knowledge related to Ruby (and programming languages in general)

Ruby will be my main focus during my 100 Days of Code challenge! If you'd like to follow my journey and learn along the way, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/100daysofruby?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) via #100DaysOfRuby and Watch or Star the repo.

### Note

There's a lot that can get in the way from learning, especially learning to code. I use all the downtime I can to learn but some days will only allow enough time for updates like "I installed this thing", "I updated the file structures in projects", or "I figured out a less terrible way to do this monotonous thing I loathe and at the same time now feel silly for having done it so terribly for so long".

### About me

Feel free to [check out the other projects](https://github.com/snelson82) I've worked on over the years and share your favorite learning resources with me. I love to learn and to make things better.

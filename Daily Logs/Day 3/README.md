# Summary

Today was focused mostly on Rails and troubleshooting Gemfiles, RVM, ruby versions, and other local machine-related issues. I learned a lot of solutions and cleaned up a bunch of "leftover" edits and package manager files that were no longer needed.

One nice change was the fact that Terminal now opens immediately instead of the 4-7 seconds that I was getting used to. my Rails app is up and running with a model/view/controller already working to create one of the objects I'll need to use.
